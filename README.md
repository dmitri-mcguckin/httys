# How To Train Your Skynet (HTTYS)

An idle-game about being an e1337 hacker and training viruses to take over the world. The game features an attack system, a contract system, and a skill-tree system.
You will be able to acquire contracts that require certain attacks to be executed. Once an attack has reached 100% you will be rewarded with more bits. Use your bits
and money to buy skill points that can be used to further increase your Skynet's abilities such as faster bit generation and detection avoidance. 

## Live Demo
